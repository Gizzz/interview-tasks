bin-tree-traverse task
// ===================

todo:
  write more test

done:
  (limited) set ref for node - only if parent node has right child
    use the depth-first traversal
  (complete) set ref for node - if there is any child on right side at same level

ideas:
  cheat solution - keep track of parent ref on node
