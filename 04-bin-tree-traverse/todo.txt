bin-tree-traverse task
// ===================

todo:
  set ref for node - if there is any child on right side at same level
    use the breadth-first traversal

done:
  set ref for node - only if parent node has right child
    use the depth-first traversal

ideas:
  cheat solution - keep track of parent ref on node
